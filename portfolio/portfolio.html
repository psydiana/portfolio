    <p>
       It's a pleasure to see you here! My name is Diana and<br>
       I'm a 21-year-old Brazilian American programmer and<br>
       translator. My focus ranges from video games, which<br>
       are my passion, to robotics, A.I., forensics and so on in<br>
       the astonishing field of computer science.

    <h2>⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ABOUT ME⋆⋅☆⋅⋆</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 140%; background-color: #837294; height: 380px"> I have experience with translations and text revisions. I've lived and<br>
    studied both in the United States and Brazil for at least a decade each.<br><br>
    I am completely fluent in English and Brazilian Portuguese while also<br>
    being knowledgeable of French, having studied the latter at<br>
    Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES). In addition, I was taught Spanish by natives and educational services, other than a bit of<br>long lost Japanese.<br><br>
    Today, I take Computer Science at Vila Velha University<br>
    (Universidade Vila Velha - UVV). Formerly, I studied Psychology and<br>
    Law for some time at FAESA.<br><br>
    I am open to internships and flexible jobs.</p>
