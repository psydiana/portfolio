        <p>
        It's a pleasure to see you here! My name is Diana and<br>
        I'm a 21-year-old Brazilian American programmer and<br>
        translator. My focus ranges from video games, which<br>
        are my passion, to robotics, A.I., forensics and so on in<br>
        the astonishing field of computer science.
